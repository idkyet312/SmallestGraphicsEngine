# Models Folder

Place your GLB or GLTF model files here.

## Supported Formats
- `.glb` - Binary GLTF (recommended)
- `.gltf` - Text-based GLTF with separate files

## Where to Find Models
- [Sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) - Large collection of free 3D models
- [Poly Haven](https://polyhaven.com/models) - Free CC0 models
- [Quaternius](http://quaternius.com/) - Free low-poly models
- [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/assets) - Free game assets

## Example
1. Download a `.glb` file
2. Place it in this folder (e.g., `models/cube.glb`)
3. In the application UI:
   - Check "Show Model"
   - Enter path: `models/cube.glb`
   - Click "Load GLB/GLTF"

## Tips
- Smaller files load faster (<10MB recommended)
- GLB format is preferred (single file)
- Models with textures may need additional setup
